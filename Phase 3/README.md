### **Fluent Validation**

[FluentValidation](https://fluentvalidation.net/) is a server-side framework and does not provide any client-side validation directly. However, it can provide metadata that, when applied to the generated HTML elements, can be used by a client-side framework such as jQuery Validate. It operates in a similar way as ASP.NET's default validation attributes.
